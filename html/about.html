<h1>Our Story</h1>
<hr width="90%" size="2" align="center">

<p>Our company started out of a class of 4 junior web developers at the New York Code and Design Academy in 2016. The class was simply given the task of collaborating on a website for a project. With the Halloween season in sight we considered a pumpkin carving academy. This first started as a joke but further went on to develop into the business we now have today. As we continue to write our story, change lives and carve pumpkins, we are thrilled to continue developing more expert carvers! </p>
