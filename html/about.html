	"Throughout out my journey to this point, everything that I accomplished came as a result of upward toiling, sweat, tears, failures and disappointments. Largely, the only privilege that was noticeable to me was that I had life, health, family and another day with 24 hours to capitalize on. I do not know what it is like to have a silver stairs nor a gold spoon given to me, but for me, that wasn’t an excuse not to succeed. After migrating to the United States a little over two years ago from Jamaica, my mindset has not changed, and has only matured even more, developing more grit each day.   One challenging experience that readily comes to mind, takes me back to when I was in college and how I had to learn time management and self discipline in order to make it from year one to year four without sacrificing my drive for excellence." </div> </div>
